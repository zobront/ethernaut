# Ethernaut Solutions

Completed solutions for all Ethernaut challenges using Ethers.js and Hardhat.

All solutions are in the /scripts folder, annotated with basic comments to explain the exploit. When contracts are required, they are located in the /contracts folder, and deployed automatically from the scripts.

To run solutions:
- Clone this repo and run `npm i` to install dependencies. 
- Go to the solution script and input your instance's address.
- Run `npx hardhat run scripts/LEVEL` to run the script.
